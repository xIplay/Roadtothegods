# Roadtothegods
line 2 -40 - Here you will find all the ideas and thing I want to implement in my games. Any help will be greatly apreaciated!
Part 1- The Main idea of the game:
The game is a clicker/Incremental RPG game with a touch of turn base style.
The player( you) need to get climb the tower.
The tower is going to consist of different floors.
In each floor there will be 7 monster, 1 boss , 1 guardian that only appear after you have kill the monster and boss a certain amount of time.
To kill the monster you can click on them reducing their hp by the amount of damage.Everytime you attack the monster the will attack you.
Killing the moster will give you Exp, Souls(will be currency and prestige system of the game), *Evuentally they will drop equipments.*
In every 5th floor you will be able to fight one of the gods of the tower. To unlock this battle you will have to slay all the guardian from previous to this floor.

Gods:
The battle system for the god battle is going to be a turn base similar to pokemon were you have 4 skill to attack which you can change, you will have items as well.
In this battle these going to be status aliments.
Eventually Elements added to the gods which will make the resistant to different skills

The servants: 
The servant will be your auto system in the game.
You can buy servant with souls , these servant can kill the enemys for your by you clicking a check box to activate this feature.They cant automatically kill the gods for you.But they will be able to participate in any event that requiere the player to click.
In the servant hall you can summon the servant, train your servant and enchance your servants.
Servant will inherited the players attack. At first only half but as you train them they will eventually be more stronger than you.
When you enchance a servant it will increase the amount of EXP and Souls you recieve by killing monster.

Prestige System:
The game will not have a typical prestige/rebirth system when you restar your level to gain permant buff. Instead each adquire soul will boost your stats by 1%(this could change). Meaning that buying something will decrease the boost but will add a permanets ability or function.


Player:
The player is going to have the following stats
Attack , defense, amount of servant , amount of souls , mp and hp , ect.
Active skills are skill only use for gods battle.
Passive Skill are going to affect the clicking part of the game as well as the gods battler.Ex:
--Increase soul gain, exp gain, attack , defense , lower price of servant, boss dmg, gods damage, resistants to aliments, hp increases, ect.

Events:
These event are going to be speacial floor with speacil monster providing extra amount of experience or souls depend on the events. 
Other event Im going to add is speacil skill events were only defeting a special god you can adquiere those skills.

Dungeons:
In the dungeons you will have the chance to battle the gods after you have defeat them the first time.The gods will have infinite hp. The amount of damage will be calculated and provide rewards.
